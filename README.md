## Project Proposal

### Overview

User based web-app to help users predict which products may be good fits for their skin by using a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- List any APIs or data sources you're planning on using here. 

    Provide shoppers with more control via filters for cosmetic concerns, key ingredients, and allergies.
