## Project Proposal

### Overview

User based web-app to help users predict which products may be good fits for their skin by using a content-based recommendation system where the 'content' will be the chemical components of cosmetics.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- List any APIs or data sources you're planning on using here. 

    Provide shoppers with more control via filters for cosmetic concerns, key ingredients, and allergies.

    still waiting to get API access.. I emailed and waiting for response^^

### Data

- List data you'll want to store in your database
        --Link in Frodo for data model--

### Roadmap

#### MVP

 - Display information re: ingredients for each cosmetic product
 - User is able to see different recommendations based on the product they are reading about


#### 2.0

### Notes

For the 'far' future, want to work on building with my own data for the products
